# Udemy - Spring Boot Microservices and Spring Cloud

This video course is for Beginners who have never build RESTful Web Services and Microservices before. It will guide you step-by-step through basics and will help you create and run RESTful Microservices from scratch. You will learn how to run Microservices on your own developer's machine as well as in Docker Containers on AWS EC2 Linux machines.

By the end of this course you will have your own RESTful Spring Boot Microservices built and running in Spring Cloud.

##### You will learn how to create and run your own:
- RESTful Microservices,
- Eureka Discovery Service,
- Zuul API Gateway,
- Load Balancer,
- Spring Cloud Config Server,

##### You will learn to use:
- Spring Cloud Bus and Rabbit MQ,
- Spring Boot Actuator

##### You will also learn how to implement for your REST API features like:
- User Authentication(Login) and,
- User Authorization(Registration)

##### You will learn to use:
- Spring Security and JWT

##### You will learn how to use:

- Spring Initializer

##### This course also covers how to:
- Trace HTTP Requests with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin(Distributed tracing)
- Aggregate log files in one place(Centralized logging) with ELK stack(Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana).

##### You will also learn how to:
- Start up AWS EC2 Linux machine,
- Install Docker,
